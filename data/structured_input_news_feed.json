Preorders for the iPhone 15 have begun, and some analysts see solid demand. However, despite the positive sentiment, there are concerns about Apple's consistency in driving sales growth. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives is encouraged by the strong preorders for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models, which could lead to a mini super-cycle and increase confidence in estimates for the holiday quarter. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('NVDA', 19), which changed on 0.15% last trading day: </strong><br />Nvidia's stock price may be forming a bearish reversal pattern, raising concerns among investors. However, the company's strong earnings growth and price strength make it a stock to watch.

Despite this, Microsoft is seen as a good investment opportunity in the technology industry, with strong potential for growth in AI and cloud computing. Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe Microsoft has the potential to double its earnings per share by FY27 backed by AI and cloud adoption. However, there is steep competition in the AI race, which could pose challenges for Microsoft to retain its dominance. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('GOOG', 12), which changed on 0.48% last trading day: </strong><br />The news articles revolve around Alphabet Inc.

The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) experienced both bullish and bearish patterns in the stock market. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('ADBE', 14), which changed on 0.67% last trading day: </strong><br />Adobe (ADBE) reported record-breaking revenue in Q3, benefiting from high demand for digital content creation software. However, despite the earnings beat, Adobe shares fell almost 5% due to a relatively disappointing outlook for the current quarter. Analysts remain bullish on the stock, with Goldman Sachs raising the price target from $550 to $625.

The cost of imports registered its biggest increase in 15 months due to higher oil prices. The New York Fed's Empire State factory gauge rebounded in September. President Biden gave a speech comparing \"Bidenomics\" to \"MAGAnomics,\" but polling shows Americans aren't sold on either.

Additionally, federal prosecutors are widening their probe into the personal benefits that Tesla CEO Elon Musk may have received. Despite these challenges, some analysts still believe in Tesla's long-term growth potential. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('SPY', 11), which changed on 0.40% last trading day: </strong><br />The S&amp;P 500 is trading at 20x forward earnings, implying significant interest rate cuts next year.

Amazon's stock has been performing well, with a 50% increase and positive earnings reported. Interms of content, Amazon Prime Video and Freevee will feature new shows and seasons in October. Additionally, Amazon's investment in AI start-up Anthropic shows its commitment to staying at the forefront of the AI race. Despite an ongoing antitrust lawsuit by the Federal Trade Commission and 17 states, investors still see potential in Amazon's stock. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('NVDA', 14), which changed on 2.95% last trading day: </strong><br />Goldman Sachs has added NVIDIA Corp to its conviction list, stating that the chipmaker is the main \"shovel provider\" in the AI gold rush. Goldman Sachs believes that NVIDIA is well-positioned to take advantage of increasing demand as supply dynamics improve. This positive commentary has caused NVIDIA shares to rise.<br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('MSFT', 10), which changed on 1.92% last trading day: </strong><br />Microsoft's strong earnings growth and price strength make it a top stock to watch. The company's move into artificial intelligence is paying off, leading to potential major boosts to earnings. Microsoft has also boosted its dividend payout, with potential for significant growth over the next 20 years. Despite optimistic recommendations from Wall Street analysts, the effectiveness of this metric is questionable. Overall, Microsoft remains an attractive investment option with a broad customer base and significant market opportunity. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('AAPL', 25), which changed on 1.48% last trading day:</strong><br />Apple has identified software issues and certain third-party applications as the primary causes for its latest iPhone 15 devices becoming unusually warm. The company assured users that corrective measures are in progress. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts remain optimistic about Apple's stock, with an average brokerage recommendation equivalent to a Buy. However, there are concerns that investors could regret buying the stock right now due to past returns not necessarily indicating future results. Additionally, Apple is reportedly shifting its production away from China and towards India in an effort to reduce its dependence on China and alleviate geopolitical risks. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('TSLA', 18), which changed on 0.55% last trading day: </strong><br />Tesla reported lower-than-expected vehicle production and delivery numbers for the third quarter, causing shares to initially trade down more than 2%. Tesla produced 430,488 vehicles and delivered 435,059 vehicles in the quarter, both down from the previous quarter. The majority of the vehicles produced were Models 3 and Y. Analysts expressed disappointment with the delivery numbers, with some lowering their estimates for the quarter. Despite the lower numbers, Tesla maintains its full-year volume target of around 1.8 million vehicles. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('META', 14), which changed on 2.2% last trading day: </strong><br />Truist Securities analyst Youssef Squali reiterated a Buy rating on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META) with a price target of $390, citing expectations for strong revenue growth and AI innovations. Meta Connect's AI products, including AI Assistants and image editing tools, demonstrated technological advancements and potential avenues for monetization. Meta's stock is on track to benefit from solid catalysts and has the potential to become a trillion-dollar company. However, there is a potential backlash against Meta's return-to-work mandate, which could lead to further employee exits. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('SPY', 9), which changed on -0.04% last trading day: </strong><br />The stock market took a hit on Friday as the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust declined by 0.2%, extending monthly drops to 5%, making September the most challenging month for the S&amp;P 500 in 2023. Congress is likely to miss the Saturday midnight deadline to secure government funding, setting the stage for a shutdown. Economists believe that a potential government shutdown will not lead to an immediate recession, but could negatively impact economic growth if it is prolonged. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 index is hovering just 2 percentage points above its 200-day moving average, which is seen as a critical support level. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('GOOG', 11), which changed on 2.52% last trading day: </strong><br />Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is expected to beat earnings estimates in its next quarterly report as it has a strong earnings surprise history and the right combination of key ingredients. Billionaire Bill Ackman believes that Alphabet will be a dominant player in artificial intelligence (AI) for a long time. Alphabet is seen as a value-oriented bet on the AI opportunity and is attracting investor attention. The growing adoption of AI in the cloud services market could also benefit Alphabet. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('NKE', 12), which changed on -1.11% last trading day: </strong><br />Nike's stock price increased after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings. Analysts from Goldman Sachs, Telsey Advisory Group, Oppenheimer, Morgan Stanley, and Keybanc reiterated positive ratings on the stock. Nike's earnings beat was driven by higher margins, and the company provided positive commentary on retail sell-through trends and back-to-school sales. However, Nike's first-quarter revenue of $12.939 billion missed expectations. Some investors may be interested in earning dividends from Nike, as the company currently has a dividend yield of 1.52%. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('COST', 19), which changed on 1.12% last trading day: </strong><br />Costco Wholesale Corporation is expected to experience robust growth in fiscal year 2024, according to analyst forecasts. Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman predicts that gas price increases will aid comparable sales, and traffic is expected to increase while average ticket prices decrease slightly. Additionally, digital sales are projected to remain flat year-over-year. Costco's recent venture into selling gold bars has proved to be successful, with the bars selling out within hours of being made available online.

Nvidia is considered one of the top AI investments and is leading in metrics such as return on invested capital. The company is also gaining traction in a lucrative market that could boost its top line over the long run. However, Nvidia's high valuation led to volatility in September due to macroeconomic conditions. Nevertheless, Goldman Sachs believes Nvidia is positioned to take advantage of increasing demand in the AI space and maintains its status as the industry standard. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('AMZN', 21), which changed on 0.23% last trading day: </strong><br />Amazon is facing an antitrust lawsuit from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleging monopolistic practices. Despite this, smart investors believe in Amazon's potential for growth, particularly in the areas of cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon is also making moves to enter India's satellite communications industry with its Project Kuiper. Additionally, analysts foresee a bright future for Amazon's cloud business, with a potential annual revenue opportunity of $25 billion. However, the lawsuit and regulatory challenges could pose a risk to the company's stock. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('TSLA', 17), which changed on -0.33% last trading day: </strong><br />Shares of Tesla (TSLA) have dropped 37% from their all-time high, despite a strong performance this year. Tesla also recently lowered the prices of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the U.S. by 2.65% to 4.23%. Analysts have expressed concerns about Tesla's Q3 delivery numbers, as the company failed to meet expectations. However, some analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing high demand and potential for future growth. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('AAPL', 17), which changed on 0.85% last trading day: </strong><br />Warren Buffett's portfolio has almost half of its value invested in Apple stock, which has been a key driver of profits for Berkshire Hathaway. Despite a recent sell-off, Apple's long-term potential suggests it's a good time to buy. Zacks.com users have been closely following Apple, indicating strong prospects for the stock. However, there are concerns about the company's growth and valuation, leading to downgrades from analysts. The latest iPhone models have also faced issues with software and apps causing overheating. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('DJIA', 18), which changed on 1.01% last trading day: </strong><br />The news articles primarily cover various topics related to the stock market and the US economy. Some notable points include the bull market turning one year old but showing signs of post-peak performance, the impact of stock market selloff on Biden's re-election chances, a significant drop in US consumer credit as student loan payments resume, a strong gain in hiring in September indicating a hot labor market, and the shrinking US trade deficit. Other articles discuss the potential impact of rising Treasury yields, the volatility of the stock market in October, and the surging oil prices. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('GOOG', 14), which changed on 0.56% last trading day: </strong><br />Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), the parent company of Google, has been receiving attention from investors and analysts. The average brokerage recommendation for Alphabet is a Buy, although some question the effectiveness of this metric. Analyst Thomas Champion of Piper Sandler reiterates an Overweight rating on Alphabet, expecting it to be an AI winner and raising revenue forecasts for Google Cloud and YouTube. Alphabet is seen as a value-oriented bet on the growing AI opportunity. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('SPY', 8), which changed on 0.64% last trading day: </strong><br />The stock market's earnings spread to Treasuries is now below spreads offered by the investment grade bond market, indicating a correction. In September, there was a slight deceleration in the expansion of the U.S. services sector due to elevated interest rates and uncertainty surrounding a government shutdown. Data reveals that top corporate leaders forecast an 84% chance of a recession, while the Federal Reserve staff assigns a negligible probability. The stock market took a hit as conservatives derailed efforts to avert a government shutdown, leading to the worst month for the S&amp;P 500 in 2023. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('META', 12), which changed on 0.93% last trading day: </strong><br />Meta Platforms Inc. (formerly known as Facebook) is attracting attention from investors and analysts. Within the last quarter, there have been a mix of bullish and bearish analyst ratings for the stock.

Analysts have lowered their price targets for the stock, citing worries about the timing of the debt offering and its impact on investors. However, some analysts believe that the selling of Rivian's stock has been overdone and that the dilution from the debt conversion may not be significant. Rivian is expected to exceed production targets in 2023, but this hasn't helped to alleviate concerns. <br /><br /><strong>NEWS SUMMARY for ('DIS', 13), which changed on 2.12% last trading day: </strong><br />Walt Disney's Indian media rights holder for the ICC Men's World Cup 2023, Disney Star, is projected to generate INR 4,000 crore ($480 million) in ad revenue for the tournament. The broadcaster has already secured 24 sponsors and over 500 advertisers. Disney's stock hit a nine-year low recently, prompting activist investor Nelson Peltz to become active again. Additionally, Disney is making changes and facing challenges due to the Hollywood strike and increased competition from other media companies. </div><div class=\"t-redactor__text\">***************************************************************<br /><strong>[</strong><strong style=\"color: rgb(120, 110, 11);\">GPT4 model 1 day summary</strong><strong>] MARKET NEWS SUMMARY ('multiple_tickers', 270) -- i.e. 270 news summary for the last 24 hours before 09/10/2023 20:31 UTC time:</strong><br />***************************************************************<br />- Clearway Energy (CWEN) shares increased by 10.8% due to a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions.<br />- Israeli pharma stocks, including Teva, fell after a severe Hamas attack.<br />- Continued tech stock sell-off expected to result in instability in October.<br />- The Israel-Hamas conflict pushed oil prices up by 5%, leading investors to tap leveraged energy ETFs for quick profits.<br />- BlackRock, a digital payments company, likely saw an increase in AUM in Q3 due to inflows.<br />- Nasdaq Composite fell over 1% due to an escalation in the Israel-Hamas conflict.<br />- Sanofi plans to acquire Mirati Therapeutics for $58 per share in cash, a deal tied to a regulatory milestone.<br />- Chorus (formerly Applied Digital Corporation) slightly beat Wall Street Q1 sales estimates.<br />- Infosys' Q2 2024 results expected to show negative impact due to slowing IT spending and longer decision cycles due to a challenging macroeconomic environment.<br />- Arcutis' (ARQT) shares rose after FDA approval for label expansion of Zoryve to treat plaque psoriasis in 6-11-year-olds. <br />- AI expenditure skyrocketing to $6 trillion, analysts identify key stocks for growth.<br />- The Middle East conflict could disrupt conditions that might have eased the tight supply condition in the oil market.<br />- Imperial Petroleum repurchased 2.58 million warrants for an aggregate purchase price of $0.62 million.<br />- Skechers is set to thrive due to its innovative products, compelling collaborations, and expanding global footprint.<br />- Ross Stores and Casey's General Stores outperform this year in the Retail-Wholesale sector.<br />- Collapse of expected US-Saudi oil deal due to Israel-Hamas war could disrupt the oil market, says Goldman Sachs.<br />- GARP strategy recommended for investors; focus on stocks like Cat, AOS, CDW, and ADP.<br />- Manitowoc's ongoing market strength predicted due to strong demand, aftermarket sales growth, and innovative products.<br />- AMC Entertainment shares surge as company sees higher than average trading volume and positive trend in earnings estimate revisions.<br />- Yum China stocks expected to surge, as company draws new members with geographic-specific deals despite inflationary pressures concerns.<br />- GameStop hits new 52-week low, spurring speculations of a potential Meme Rally.<br />- DexCom plans G7 CGM system launch in Canada.<br />- Renewed optimism in Teleflex among investors due to growth in its Vascular, Interventional, and Surgical businesses.</div><div class=\"t-redactor__text\">***************************************************************<br /><strong style=\"color: rgb(120, 110, 11);\">[GPT3.5-Turbo model 10 days summary</strong><strong>] MARKET NEWS SUMMARY ('multiple_tickers', 1971) -- i.e. 1971 news summarised for the period 2023-09-29 to 2023-10-09</strong><br />***************************************************************<br /><ul><li>US stock markets ended mixed as investors processed the effects of the US inflation report on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy.</li><li>The headline PCE price index rose to 3.5% in August 2023, up from 3.4% in July, marking its second monthly increase.</li><li>Energy and financial sectors experienced losses, while energy maintained its position as the highest-gaining sector for the quarter.</li><li>Tesla reported a jump in deliveries for September and the third quarter.</li><li>SmileDirectClub filed for bankruptcy just a few years after its IPO.</li><li>Costco announced $29 doctor visits as part of its entry into healthcare.</li><li>Coca-Cola's ESG strategy may appeal to ethical investors.</li><li>Verizon is offering members access to $29 virtual primary care visits.</li><li>Semiconductor companies face challenges in losing their biggest customers.</li><li>Italy and the UK lead European renewable energy investment.</li><li>Fiverr and Roblox are considered top growth stocks.</li><li>ArcelorMittal and General Electric are among the stocks recording losses in pre-market trading.</li><li>Nvidia and Intel are teaming up with FAANG to take on Nvidia's dominance in AI chips and software.</li><li>High-yield stocks, such as Pipeline GP Holdings and Plains GP Holdings, are being bought by insiders.</li><li>FedEx, Disney, and Constellation Brands are part of Zacks Earnings Preview.</li><li>REITs, including W.P.
