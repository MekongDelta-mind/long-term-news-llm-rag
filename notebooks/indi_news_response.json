While it beat subscriber estimates with 5.9 million paid net adds, its Q2 revenue of $8.19 billion missed expectations.

The company is also rolling out paid sharing to more countries and has dropped its cheapest streaming plan without ads in the US and UK to push users towards its ad-supported service. Despite these developments, some caution that the stock may be overvalued."
