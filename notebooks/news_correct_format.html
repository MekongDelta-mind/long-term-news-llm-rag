	Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya believes that Tesla is experiencing its "iPhone moment" and is on the verge of a major breakthrough. Meanwhile, investor David Trainer argues that Tesla is overvalued by over 1,000% due to its
	"disconnected" fundamentals. Tesla\'s second-quarter earnings report showed a rise in sales but also highlighted concerns about profitability and margins. Tesla\'s stock price dropped around 9% in response to the report. Despite mixed
	opinions, some analysts remain bullish on Tesla\'s future growth potential.<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<strong><em>NEWS SUMMARY for (\'MSFT\', 11), which changed on 0.06% last trading day:</em></strong> <br />
	Indian company Birlasoft has partnered with Microsoft to establish a Generative AI Centre of Excellence. The aim is to accelerate value creation and foster innovation in the adoption of Generative AI, providing enterprise solutions
	across industries. The center will bring together Birlasoft\'s industry expertise and Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to facilitate research, training, and collaboration. Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss maintains an Overweight rating
	on Microsoft and believes the company has strong potential in the Generative AI space. <br />
	<br />
	<strong><em>NEWS SUMMARY for (\'AAPL\', 11), which changed on 0.51% last trading day:</em> </strong><br />
	Warren Buffett\'s investment in Apple has resulted in Berkshire Hathaway\'s stake in the company ballooning to nearly $180 billion, with the stock price surging nearly 50%. The rise in Apple\'s stock price is partly attributed to
	excitement around artificial intelligence. However, there are concerns of weak demand and a potential delay in the launch of the next iPhone, which could result in lower iPhone sales. Despite this, Morgan Stanley is bullish on India\'s
	growth potential for Apple and expects strong revenue and user growth in the country. <br />
	<br />
	<strong><em>NEWS SUMMARY for (\'AMZN\', 11), which changed on -0.94% last trading day: </em></strong><br />
	Amazon is planning to provide high-speed internet worldwide through its Project Kuiper. This initiative may have a positive impact on the company\'s stock. Users on Zacks.com have been closely following Amazon, indicating strong
	interest in the stock. Amazon Prime Video and Freevee will have new content available in August 2023, including "The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart" and "Cocaine Bear." A Truist analyst predicts robust revenue for Amazon, driven by strong
	e-commerce demand and cost optimization. However, Amazon is facing challenges regarding warehouse safety as hearings on OSHA violations begin. <br />
	<br />
	<strong><em>NEWS SUMMARY for (\'NFLX\', 19), which changed on -0.23% last trading day: </em></strong><br />
	Netflix\'s stock has been fluctuating after the company reported mixed quarterly results. While it beat subscriber estimates with 5.9 million paid net adds, its Q2 revenue of $8.19 billion missed expectations. However, some analysts
	remain optimistic about Netflix\'s future growth and expect it to rebound. The company is also rolling out paid sharing to more countries and has dropped its cheapest streaming plan without ads in the US and UK to push users towards its
	ad-supported service. Despite these developments, some caution that the stock may be overvalued. <br />
	<br />
	<strong><em>NEWS SUMMARY for (\'VZ\', 13), which changed on 1.39% last trading day: </em></strong><br />
	Verizon Business and the VA Palo Alto Health Care System have partnered to deploy a full spectrum private 5G network, creating the first full spectrum 5G hospital. This network will enable unprecedented care for veterans and improve
	healthcare services. Verizon Communications will report second-quarter 2023 earnings on July 25. Verizon is also continuing to upgrade its network in various locations, including Kentucky, Cleveland, and Daytona. Despite a recent plunge
	in stock value, Verizon\'s high dividend yield and potential for capital appreciation make it an attractive investment. <br />
	<br />
	<strong><em>NEWS SUMMARY for (\'CVNA\', 21), which changed on -2.46% last trading day: </em></strong><br />
	Carvana, an online used car dealer, announced major updates that could have significant implications for investors. The company reported solid quarterly results, a favorable debt deal, and newly enabled access to equity capital,
	reducing liquidity risks. Despite a recent downgrade from RBC Capital due to concerns over margins and unit economics, other analysts have maintained positive outlooks for the stock. Carvana\'s stock soared nearly 50% after its
	second-quarter earnings report beat expectations. The company also announced a debt restructuring deal with bondholders, expected to improve liquidity. <br />
	<br />
	<strong><em>NEWS SUMMARY for (\'DJIA\', 8), which changed on -0.58% last trading day: </em></strong><br />
	The stock market rally is expected to continue as long as there is no sign of a recession, according to Steve Eisman of Neuberger Berman. However, experts caution that transportation stocks should not be overestimated as an indicator of
	the overall economy. US bank lending has fallen slightly, while housing starts and retail sales have also shown weakness. Overall, the US economy is in a precarious state with concerns of a possible recession by February. <br />
	<br />
	<strong><em>NEWS SUMMARY for (\'SPY\', 7), which changed on 0.44% last trading day: </em></strong><br />
